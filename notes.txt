A few notes based on the algorithm :



Maybe we can show some examples of what works well what doesn't work well?
Noise - Old Movies? 

Modern movies where background stays the same?

Modern movies where background is moving a LOT. like a mountain and driving.


- I know the algo has quite a few assumptions that are pretty specific. So yea



See how this changes when in different color spaces???

See how this could change when in Lab, CIE, something else?

- There is an existing paper that does this, on RGB and HSV.
