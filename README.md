Test video:
Here are some test videos used in previous research:
1. The Wallpaper dateset (commonly used): https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54651

2. A list of available dataset:(human activities) https://sites.google.com/site/backgroundsubtraction/test-sequences/human-activities

3. Another list (animals observations): https://sites.google.com/site/backgroundsubtraction/test-sequences/animals

Lots of them are focused on traffic and pedastrians.
