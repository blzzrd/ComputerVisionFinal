# Computer Vision Final Project

Orchestrated by *Alejandro Castaneda and Renee Wu* at Portland State
University for CS 410 - Computer Vision with Feng Liu.

The following project compares the Teknomo-Fernandez algorithm, a spin-off of
a Monte-Carlo inspired algorithm, and the median filter to view which algorithm
works best with 

[Teknomo-Fernandez Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00889)

[Implementation for the Monte-Carlo inspired algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273391116_A_Monte-Carlo-based_Algorithm_for_Background_Generation.)
