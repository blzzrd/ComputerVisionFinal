# Computer Vision Final Project

Orchestrated by **Alejandro Castaneda and Renee Wu** at Portland State
University for CS 410 - Computer Vision with Feng Liu.

The following project compares the Teknomo-Fernandez algorithm, a spin-off of
a Monte-Carlo inspired algorithm, and the median filter to view which algorithm
works best to generate background images in varying sets of datas.
